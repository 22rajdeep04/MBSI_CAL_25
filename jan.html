            Mycoremediation is a branch of bioremediation that uses fungi to degrade environmental pollutants. Under
            this process, the natural metabolic processes of fungi and mainly the enzymes are used to break down a wide
            range of contaminants such as hydrocarbons, pesticides, heavy metals and complex organic compounds.
            Mycoremediation is a method that utilises fungi mycelium in contaminated soil sites as a remedial treatment.
            <br>

            <h4>Why Fungi? </h4> <br>
            Fungi have a better edge and are uniquely suited for the complex process of mycoremediation due to their
            ability to produce a vast range of extracellular enzymes that can break down complex organic molecules into
            simpler, less harmful substances. Unlike bacteria, which are limited to degrading pollutants in aqueous
            environments, fungi can colonise and penetrate solid substrates, such as soil, wood, and organic matter.
            This ability is particularly important in the degradation of pollutants like polycyclic aromatic
            hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dioxins, which are often tightly bound to solid
            matrices and are resistant to bacterial degradation. <br>

            <h4>Phanerochaete chrysosporium- The main strain for Mycoremediation</h4> <br>
            Among the fungi used in mycoremediation, Phanerochaete chrysosporium—a white-rot fungus—stands out for its
            remarkable ability to degrade some of the most toxic pollutants in the environment.
            Phanerochaete chrysosporium is one of the most studied fungi in the field of mycoremediation. As it is a
            white-rot fungus, it can degrade lignin, a complex polymer found in wood. The same enzymatic machinery that
            breaks down lignin also enables P. chrysosporium to degrade a wide range of environmental pollutants, those
            that are structurally similar to lignin.
            The most significant contribution of P. chrysosporium to mycoremediation is its ability to degrade
            polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are persistent organic pollutants that pose serious health
            risks due to their cancer inducing properties. These hydrocarbons are found in substances like oil spills
            and industrial waste. <br>
            <h4>How do they degrade these complex biomolecules?</h4><br>
            P. chrysosporium secretes lignin peroxidases and manganese peroxidases.
            These enzymes oxidise the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or PAHs
            This breaks them down into smaller, less toxic compounds.

            <h4>Use of P.chrysosporium in textile industries:-</h4><br>
            Enormous volumes of effluent are generated at different
            stages of textile manufacturing, as a result of the use of large amounts of chemicals and dyes. Effluent
            derived from the textile and dye activities can provoke serious environmental impact in the water bodies
            because of the presence of toxic reactive dyes, chlorolignin residues and dark coloration The biological
            breakdown of the chlorolignin residues and the chromophoric groups responsible for the dark coloration of
            the textile effluent can be accomplished by the use of enzymes from the white rot fungus, Phanerochaete
            chrysosporium.
            Application in Bioaugmentation:- In addition to its role in mycoremediation, P. chrysosporium is used in
            bioaugmentation, a process where specific microorganisms are introduced to contaminated environments to
            enhance the degradation of pollutants. The fungus can be added to soils or sediments contaminated with
            complex organic pollutants, such as PAHs, to accelerate the breakdown of these substances.
            These diverse applications of Phanerochaete chrysosporium shows how this microbe is essential in the removal
            of toxic substances from the soil and also help in the cleaning and detoxification of effluents released
            from the textiles industry. Beyond mycoremediation, this microbe also has importance in the
            pharmaceutical,environmental contexts.

                Motilal Madan is an Indian biotechnology researcher, veterinarian. In a career spanning over 35 years,
                Madan has published 432 research articles and policy papers including 225 original research papers. Some
                important contributions are:- <br><br>
                <b>Production of India's First Cloned Buffalo:- </b><br>
                Dr. Madan played an important role in the development of
                India’s first cloned buffalo, "Garima". This has marked a significant milestone in biotechnology and
                animal husbandry. This has helped in the replication of high-yielding and disease-resistant animals.
                <br><br>
                <b>Development of the World’s First IVF Buffalo Calf:-</b><br>
                Dr. Madan also contributed and played an important
                role in producing the world's first in vitro fertilisation (IVF) buffalo calf, named "Pratham". This
                breakthrough demonstrated the feasibility of using assisted reproductive technologies (ART) in
                buffaloes. The success of this technique paved the way for widespread use of IVF in cattle and buffalo
                breeding programs.

                Robert W.Holly was an American biochemist who made contributions in the field of
                molecular biology. His main focus was on the role of tRNA and understanding the genetic code. Some
                important contributions are:- <br><br>
                <b>Discovery and Sequencing of Transfer RNA (tRNA):-</b> <br> Robert Holley is best known for discovering and
                sequencing the first transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule, specifically alanine tRNA, in 1965. This was the
                first time that the nucleotide sequence of a nucleic acid was determined. His work showed how tRNA
                molecules function as adapters that translate genetic information from mRNA into the amino acid sequence
                of proteins. <br><br>
                <b>Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine :-</b> <br> Robert Holley was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or
                Medicine in 1968, along with Marshall W. Nirenberg and Har Gobind Khorana, for their work on the
                interpretation of the genetic code and its function in protein synthesis. Holley’s specific contribution
                was the sequencing of tRNA, which was a key component of understanding how genetic information is
                translated into proteins.
